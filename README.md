Module 2 Walkthrough and Challenge for Berkeley Data Analytics bootcamp

# Challenge
Using VBA, I have created a script to analyze stock data given certain assumptions and outputting the results to a tab within the same workbook called "All Stocks Analysis. In order for the script to accurately calculate the: Total Volume per ticker and % change in the timeframe, the worksheet must be formatted with this criteria:

- **First Column:** Stock Names/Ticker symbols. *Sorted alphabetically*
- **Second Column:** Date. *Sorted in ascending order, but secondary to Stock names* (i.e. all rows of `AY` stock must come before `CSIQ` stock and so on).
- **Third Column:** Open price
- **Sixth Column:** Close price
- **Eigth Column:** Volume

All other rows can contain any data but can not affect sorting of sheet.

Each sheet should contain one year worth of data and should be named with the year, but it is not absolutely necessary for the code to function properly.
